## Security Implementation: OWASP Top 10 2021

### A01 - Broken Access Control ✅

**Challenge:** Ensuring users can only access their own data and resources.

**Implementation:**
- JWT token validation on all protected endpoints
- User-specific data isolation through ownership validation
- Role-based access control middleware
- Protected React routes with authentication checks

```javascript
const enforceOwnership = (req, res, next) => {
  const requestedUserId = req.params.userId || req.body.userId;
  const authenticatedUserId = req.user.sub;
  
  if (requestedUserId && requestedUserId !== authenticatedUserId) {
    return res.status(403).json({ 
      error: 'Access denied. You can only access your own data.' 
    });
  }
  next();
};
```

**Learning Outcome:** Understanding the importance of verifying user permissions at every access point, not just at login.

### A03 - Injection ✅

**Challenge:** Preventing malicious code injection through user inputs.

**Implementation:**
- MongoDB parameterized queries using Mongoose ODM
- Server-side input validation with express-validator
- Client-side input sanitization with DOMPurify
- NoSQL injection prevention with express-mongo-sanitize

```javascript
const sanitizeInput = (obj) => {
  for (let key in obj) {
    if (typeof obj[key] === 'string') {
      obj[key] = obj[key]
        .replace(/<script\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\/script>)<[^<]*)*<\/script>/gi, '')
        .replace(/javascript:/gi, '');
    }
  }
};
```

**Learning Outcome:** Defense in depth - sanitization should happen at multiple layers, not just one.

**Challenge:** Properly configuring all security settings and headers.

**Implementation:**
- Helmet.js for comprehensive security headers
- Environment-based configuration management
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
- Secure CORS configuration with origin whitelisting

```javascript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN],
    },
  }
}));
```

### A06 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components ✅

**Challenge:** Maintaining up-to-date dependencies without introducing vulnerabilities.

**Implementation:**
- Regular dependency audits using `npm audit`
- Careful selection of well-maintained packages

### A07 - Identification and Authentication Failures ✅

**Challenge:** Implementing robust authentication without common pitfalls.

**Implementation:**
- Auth0 enterprise authentication with OIDC
- JWT token validation with JWKS verification
- Secure session handling with proper expiration
- Multi-factor authentication support

```javascript
const { jwtVerify, createRemoteJWKSet } = require('jose');
const JWKS = createRemoteJWKSet(new URL(`https://${process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN}/.well-known/jwks.json`));

const verifyToken = async (req, res, next) => {
  const token = authHeader.substring(7);
  const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, JWKS, {
    issuer: `https://${process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN}/`,
    audience: process.env.AUTH0_AUDIENCE,
  });
  req.user = payload;
  next();
};
```

**Key Insight:** Using established authentication providers like Auth0 eliminates many common authentication vulnerabilities.

### A08 - Software and Data Integrity Failures ✅

**Challenge:** Ensuring data integrity throughout the application lifecycle.

### A09 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures ✅

**Challenge:** Implementing comprehensive security monitoring and logging.

**Implementation:**
- Security event logging for suspicious activities
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Error tracking and security incident reporting
- Comprehensive access logging

```javascript
const securityLogger = (req, res, next) => {
  const suspiciousPatterns = [/script/i, /javascript:/i, /<.*>/];
  // Log suspicious activities
  if (suspiciousPatterns.some(pattern => pattern.test(inputValue))) {
    console.warn(`Suspicious input detected from IP ${req.ip}: ${inputValue}`);
  }
  next();
};
```

### A10 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) ✅

**Challenge:** Preventing unauthorized server-side requests to internal resources.

**Implementation:**
- URL validation for all external requests
